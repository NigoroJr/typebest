TypeBest
========

Notice
------
This is just a plan that I have in my head at this moment.  
Anything is subject to change.  
I use this ReadMe to design the program.  

Description
-----------
A program that helps you improve your typing speed.  
It is currently planned to be an offline game with no internet connection.  
However, in the future when this program's base form is made and I have the  
skills and the enviroment for online interactions, it is possible that this  
will become an online game.  

Practice Modes
--------------
The user can choose from "time", "number of characters", "alphabet(s)",  
or by "My Least Favorite".  

ToDo
----
!Create an UML diagram  
All the function in [TypeWell](http://members.jcom.home.ne.jp/gangas2/download.html)  
Record results according to keyboard layout (Qwerty, Dvorak)  
Store more than 100 (say 10,000)  
Separate dictionary files for each alphabet letter  
Allow user to choose what letter(s)  
Create separate record files for different users using the same account  

Things to think about
---------------------
How detailed should the analysis be?
