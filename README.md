TypeBest
========

Notice
------
This program is still under development.  
Anything is subject to change.  

Description
-----------
A program that helps you improve your typing speed.

An online ranking feature is planned to be added but I'm not really sure when that is going to happen.

Practice Modes
--------------
The user can choose from "time", "number of characters", "alphabet(s)", or by "My Least Favorite".  
This function is yet to be implemented.  

Tips
----
You can restart that round by clicking the restart button on the botton right corner. Another way is to press the "Escape key" twice. Although the default is set to shuffle the words in the dictionary file, you can choose to not do that.  

ToDo
----
Re-design the whole software!!!

* All the function in [TypeWell](http://members.jcom.home.ne.jp/gangas2/download.html)
* Show results according to keyboard layout (Qwerty, Dvorak)
* Separate dictionary files for each alphabet letter
* Allow user to choose which letter(s) in the alphabet
* Add endless mode
* Add ignore mistype mode
* Dialog where you can set number of letters/words and/or the time. ie, a quick config dialog.
* Add "programming" dictionary
* Add option which the user can choose whether to type all letters of the last
  word or finish when he/she reaches 400 letters
